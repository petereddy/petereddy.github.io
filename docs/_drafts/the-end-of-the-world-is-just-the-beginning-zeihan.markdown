I picked up this book recently because I'd seen positive comments
about it on sites where I've had good luck with book suggestions in
the past. Due to the seemingly alarmist title and subtitle I don't
think I'd have been interested in it otherwise. I'd delayed beginning
to read it for the same reason. I finally did get around to reading it
of course and I'm very glad I did.

The author, Peter Zeihan, is an American geopolitical
strategist. Wait! I know what you're thinking, "Geopolitical strategy?
Sounds interesting but I have an urgent need to wash my socks at the
moment."

If you've never read a book about geopolitics or economics and thought
to yourself, "This is great and all, but I do wish the writing was a
bit dryer", then here's your chance. The writing style made me imagine
I was reading a transcript of a very long TED talk.

If you can get past the writig style, and I do recommend you try,
you'll be rewarded with a hugely informative and fascinating picture
of how and why the world works, and has worked, through history. Not
to mention where, Zeihan's opinion, the world is headed.

The book was published in early June of 2022 and received last minute
additions to include a discussion of how the Russian invasion of
Ukraine of 16 February, 2022 fit into the context of the book.
