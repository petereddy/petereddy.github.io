I picked up this book recently because I had seen it praised by
several people on sites I frequent where I've had good luck with book
suggestions in the past. I don't think I'd have been interested in it
otherwise, because of the seemingly alarmist title and subtitle. I
delayed starting to read it for the same reason. I finally did read
and though, and I'm very glad I did.

The author, Peter Zeihan, is an American geopolitical
strategist. Wait, don't go! I know what you're thinking, Geopolitical
strategy? Sounds interesting but unfortunately I have to wash my
socks tonight.

The book was published in early June of 2022 and received last minute
additions to include a discussion of how the Russian invasion of
Ukraine on 16 February, 2022 fit into the context of the book.
