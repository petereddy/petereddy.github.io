Boy Oh, I've recently moved to a new location in Boston and as a result have
been forced to choose a new ISP because my previous ISP
[Starry](https://starry.com) was, sadly, not offered at the new
location.

In this review I'll be looking the three options that are available to
me in the new location at the time of writing. In the order in which I
installed them, they are:

- Comcast/Xfinity Cable
- T-Mobile 5G
- Verizon 5G

### Comcast {#comcast}
### T-Mobile {#t-mobile}
### Verizon {#verizon}

### Price

| ISP      | Price/Month | Notes                                                                    |
|----------|------------:|--------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Comcast  |      $39.00 | For the first two years, then probably $2K or something rediculous. Ugh. |
| T-Mobile |      $50.00 | Total, no extra fees                                                     |
| Verizon  |      $59.00 |                                                                          |

Obviously Comcast is the cheapest at the moment but that price is only
good for two years, after which it more than doubles. I can't remember
what the actual price is. I should dig around on their site to find
the post-intro price but I can't be arsed becuase it's not at all
obvious and I'm sure it'll be higher when the time comes anyway.

### Setup

Comcast

Comcast was the easist to set up. Just plugged it into the coax and power and it was
